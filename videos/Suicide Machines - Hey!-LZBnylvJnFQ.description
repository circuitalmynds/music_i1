Hey! What's goin' on?
Hey! What went wrong?
Hey! I don't know why?
Hey! I might as well try!

Let's go!

Well, I looked around this crazy world and tried to make some sense of it
Robbed a bank and stole a car and tried to put some dents in it
And everybody is playing games I don't know what to make of it
Don't play your stupid games 'cause you know I don't need that fucked up shit

Well, no one ever told me I was gonna get older
Turned 21 and I thought my life was over
Took a long time to get to where I am now
And I'm not gonna sit around wondering how, NO!

Well I listen to your fuckin' shit I can't make any sense of it
'Cause what goes in does not come out, you've gotta put two cents in it
You're just a blob of fuckin' jell you're brain is floating out in space
and if your eyes was worth a quarter - I'd get twenty-six cents back in change!

Well, no one ever told me that the grass would be greener
I've done a lot of things since the last time that I seen her
No one ever told me it would be this way
That's why you can't make any sense out of anything I say, NO!

(Junkie little punk!)

My world is crumbling and I don't know what to do
It's falling down around me 'cause I'm thinking of you
If we take a look at what we call our world today
Are our morals on decline or have we all gone insane?

Insane, (INSANE) [3x]
